# Arduino-Serial-over-Ethernet

To use this script you will need an Arduino Mega(recommended) with an Arduino Ethernet shield and a network connection to the other Arduino with it's own shield.

This is the initial release version, so there are bugs and some limitations.
I am working on making the stock firmware/code more friendly to conventional serial communication software.

So far this is compatible with Minicom(more clients will be tested later..) with semi-stock settings.
